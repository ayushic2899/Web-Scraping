###### Web scraping is about downloading structured data from the web, selecting some of that data, and passing along what you selected to another process.

###### If you’ve ever copy and pasted information from a website, you’ve performed the same function as any web scraper, only on a microscopic, manual scale.

## The web scraping process: 3 simple steps
1. First, our team of seasoned scraping veterans develops a scraper unique to your project, designed specifically to target and extract the data you want from the websites you want it from.
2. The data is retrieved in HTML format, after which it is carefully parsed to extricate the raw data you want from the noise surrounding it. Depending on the project, the data can be as simple as a name and address in some cases, and as complex as high dimensional weather and seed germination data the next.
3. Ultimately, the data is stored in the format and to the exact specifications of the project. Some companies use third party applications or databases to view and manipulate the data to their choosing, while others prefer it in a simple, raw format - generally as CSV, TSV or JSON.
## Web scraping is used in a variety of digital businesses that rely on data harvesting. Legitimate use cases include:
* Search engine bots crawling a site, analyzing its content and then ranking it.
* Price comparison sites deploying bots to auto-fetch prices and product descriptions for allied seller websites.
* Market research companies using scrapers to pull data from forums and social media (e.g., for sentiment analysis).
